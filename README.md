# Dirichlet-Convolution


Basically just a way to code the Dirichlet Convolution problems for my number theory work. 

Instructions to use:

First, edit the convolution call in main to make it use the functions you want it to use.
Then, compile the code. I used gcc on Arch Linux, but it should be the same for any Linux/Unix setup.
Finally, execute the executable you compiled and input the number you want to convolute.


Good thing I wrote these 50 lines instead of writing 2 lines of LaTeX
